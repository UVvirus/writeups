1)First step is to identify the type of hash. For that i used this website
https://www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/

2)From this website i found that this is an MD5 hash.

3)Now our goal is to decrypt this hash. To decrypt this hash i used
https://www.md5online.org/md5-decrypt.html

4)Paste the hash inside the box and hit the Decrypt button.

5)You'll be greeted with this:cyctfilovesalt

6)Enclose this value within the curly braces. That is the flag.


Flag: cyctf{ilovesalt}

Happy Hacking!!ðŸ˜‡
